    "**Ans:** Sampling without replacement is a sampling method where each selected item is removed from the population, and subsequent selections are made from the remaining items. In other words, once an item is selected, it is not available for selection again.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of sampling without replacement can be selecting a committee from a group of individuals. Suppose there are 10 people, and you want to form a committee of 3 members. If you use sampling without replacement, the process would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initially, all 10 individuals are available for selection.\n",
    "- You randomly select one person from the group to be the first member of the committee.\n",
    "- After selecting the first member, you now have 9 remaining individuals to choose from.\n",
    "- Next, you randomly select another person from the remaining 9 individuals to be the second member of the committee.\n",
    "- Once the second member is selected, there are 8 individuals left for the final selection.\n",
    "- Finally, you randomly choose the last person from the remaining 8 individuals to complete the committee.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, each selection reduces the available pool of individuals for subsequent selections. Sampling without replacement ensures that each selected member is unique within the committee, and no individual can be chosen more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling without replacement is commonly used in various scenarios, such as surveys, experimental design, and random sampling techniques, where it is necessary to avoid duplication and ensure that each selected item is distinct from the others."

    "**Ans:** A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research, in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The hypothesis that smoking causes cancer was first proposed in the early 1900s.\n",
    "- The hypothesis that the Earth is round was first proposed by ancient Greek philosophers.\n",
    "- The hypothesis that the universe is expanding was first proposed by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s.\n",
    "- Hypotheses are important in science because they provide a way to test our understanding of the world. By testing hypotheses, we can learn more about how the world works and improve our scientific theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the steps involved in testing a hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State the hypothesis:** The first step is to clearly state the hypothesis. This should be done in a way that is specific, testable, and falsifiable.\n",
    "- **Gather data:** The next step is to gather data that can be used to test the hypothesis. This data can be collected through experiments, observations, or surveys.\n",
    "- **Analyze the data:** Once the data has been gathered, it needs to be analyzed to see if it supports or refutes the hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Draw a conclusion:** Based on the analysis of the data, a conclusion can be drawn about whether or not the hypothesis is supported. If the hypothesis is not supported, then it may need to be revised or discarded.\n",
    "Testing hypotheses is an important part of the scientific method. It allows us to learn more about the world and improve our understanding of how it works."
